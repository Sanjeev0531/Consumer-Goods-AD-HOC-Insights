# Consumer-Goods-AD HOC Insights-SQL-Project

Domain:  Consumer Goods | Function: Executive Management

# Project Overview
This repository houses the code and SQL queries employed for the Consumer Goods section of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics. In this project, I am working with a dataset related to consumer goods. The objective is to address ten specific ad hoc requests using SQL queries. The dataset used in this project is provided by "AtliQ Hardwares," a prominent global hardware company specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers.

## Data 
This file provides a comprehensive overview of the tables found in the 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database. It includes information for six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data
2. dim_product: contains product-related data
3. fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
4. fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
5. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
6. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.

7. ## Tools Used:

1. SQL: I wrote queries to get information from the database using aggregate functions, subqueries, joining tables, CTEs and window  functions.
2. Power BI: I used this tool to turn the data into interactive charts and graphs, making it easy to understand.
3. PowerPoint: I put together a presentation to share the insights.

4. ##  Skills Learnt
1. SQL Query Writing using CTE,rank,joins, date functions,sub-queries,numeric functions etc.
2. Data Extraction and Transformation
3. Data Analysis and Interpretation
4. Report Generation
5. Problem Solving and Decision Making
